# **Deploying OpenStack on an EC2 Instance**

This document provides a comprehensive guide on setting up **OpenStack** on an **AWS EC2 instance** using DevStack. By following these steps, you will successfully deploy OpenStack and access the Horizon dashboard for cloud management.

---

## **Prerequisites**

### **1. AWS EC2 Instance Requirements**

- **AMI (Operating System):** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Latest Stable Version)
- **Instance Type:** `t2.large` (Minimum: 2 vCPUs, 8GB RAM)
- **Storage:** Allocate at least **30GB** (default 8GB is insufficient for OpenStack)
- **Key Pair:** Generate or use an existing SSH key for secure authentication.
- **Security Group Rules:**
  - **SSH (22):** Allow access from your IP.
  - **HTTP (80, 443):** Open access for the OpenStack Horizon dashboard.

### **2. Software Requirements**
- **PuTTY or Terminal** for SSH access
- **PuTTYgen** (if using PuTTY on Windows) for key conversion
- **Git** (installed on the instance)
- **Python 3** and required dependencies

---

## **1. Connecting to the EC2 Instance**

### **For Windows Users (Using PuTTY)**

1. **Convert PEM to PPK (PuTTY Private Key Format)**:
   - Open **PuTTYgen**.
   - Click **Load**, select your `.pem` file.
   - Click **Save private key** and save it as `.ppk`.

2. **Launch PuTTY and Connect to EC2**:
   - Open **PuTTY**.
   - In **Host Name**, enter the public IP of the EC2 instance.
   - Navigate to **Connection > SSH > Auth**.
   - Click **Browse**, select the `.ppk` file.
   - Click **Open** and log in as `ubuntu`.

### **For macOS & Linux Users (Using Terminal)**

```bash
chmod 400 your-key.pem
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-public-ip
```

---

## **2. Update System and Install Dependencies**

Before proceeding with the installation, update and upgrade the system packages:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y git python3-dev python3-pip net-tools
```

---

## **3. Clone the DevStack Repository**

Navigate to your home directory and clone the latest DevStack repository:

```bash
git clone https://opendev.org/openstack/devstack.git
cd devstack
```

---

## **4. Create a DevStack Configuration File**

Create and edit a `local.conf` file to customize the OpenStack installation:

```bash
nano local.conf
```

Paste the following configuration:

```ini
[[local|localrc]]
ADMIN_PASSWORD=SuperSecret
DATABASE_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
RABBIT_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
SERVICE_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD

# Automatically detect the host IP
HOST_IP=$(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}')

# Enable only essential services
disable_service tempest
disable_service cinder
disable_service swift
disable_service heat

# Use the latest OpenStack release
USE_PYTHON3=True
GIT_BASE=https://opendev.org
```

Save and exit (CTRL+X, then Y, then ENTER).

## **5. Install OpenStack Using DevStack**

Run the DevStack installation script, which may take **30-45 minutes**:

```bash
./stack.sh
```

If the installation is successful, you will see a confirmation message: `DevStack installed successfully!`.

---

## **6. Access the OpenStack Horizon Dashboard**

Once the installation is complete, access the OpenStack **Horizon UI** by opening a web browser and navigating to:

```bash
http://your-ec2-public-ip/dashboard
```

### **Login Credentials:**
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `SuperSecret` (as defined in `local.conf`)

---

## **7. Verify OpenStack Services**

Before proceeding with cloud management, confirm that OpenStack services are running:

```bash
source openrc admin admin
openstack service list
```

If successful, you should see a list of active OpenStack services.

## **8. Conclusion**

You have successfully deployed OpenStack on an AWS EC2 instance. You can now use the Horizon Dashboard or OpenStack CLI to manage cloud instances, networking, and storage.
